# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "leakygut" project - currently an empty repository that appears to be related to health/medical information, likely focusing on leaky gut syndrome or digestive health.

## Repository Status

This repository is currently empty and ready for initial project setup. Future instances of Claude Code should help establish the project structure based on the user's requirements.

## Development Guidelines

Since this is a health-related project, ensure that:
- Any medical information is clearly marked as educational only
- Include appropriate disclaimers about consulting healthcare professionals
- Follow data privacy best practices if handling user health data
- Maintain high code quality standards for health-related applications

## Available Tools & Capabilities

### Containerization & Testing
- **Orb/OrbStack** - Docker commands and container management
- **Test environments** - Isolated environments for development and testing
- Can spin up databases, services, and full application stacks in containers

### VS Code Integration
- **Operating inside VS Code** - Full IDE integration and capabilities
- **Language diagnostics** - Access to VS Code's error/warning system
- **Jupyter integration** - Execute code in Jupyter kernels
- **Notebook editing** - Direct manipulation of .ipynb files
- **Extensions access** - GitLens, Python, debugging tools, etc.

### Development Environment
- Full access to Docker commands via Bash tool
- Container orchestration for microservices
- Database containers (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- Isolated testing environments
- VS Code terminal integration

## Next Steps for Project Setup

When the user begins development, consider:
1. Determining the project type (web app, mobile app, documentation site, etc.)
2. Setting up appropriate package management (npm, yarn, pip, etc.)
3. Establishing testing framework
4. Creating proper project structure with containerized services
5. Setting up Docker containers for databases and external services
6. Setting up linting and code formatting
7. Adding appropriate health/medical disclaimers

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md will need to be updated once the project structure and technology stack are established.
