## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (If Continuing)

### 1. Deploy to Nexcess Hosting
```bash
# All deployment files are ready in /src directory
# Upload contents of /src to Nexcess hosting account
# Import database schema from /src/database/schema.sql
# Configure database credentials in /src/config/config.php
```

### 2. Production Configuration
- [ ] Update database credentials in `src/config/config.php`
- [ ] Set production BASE_URL in configuration
- [ ] Enable production error logging
- [ ] Configure SSL/HTTPS redirects
- [ ] Set up automated database backups

### 3. Initial Data Population
```bash
# Populate food database with AIP foods
mysql -u username -p database_name < src/database/food_data.sql

# Or use the admin interface to add foods manually
# Access: /admin/manage-foods.php
```

### 4. User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Test complete user journey: registration → setup → daily logging → progress review
- [ ] Verify mobile experience on actual devices
- [ ] Test data export functionality with healthcare providers
- [ ] Validate motivational features drive engagement

## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### Database Setup (Priority 1)
```sql
-- Import the complete schema
mysql -u username -p database_name < src/database/schema.sql

-- Import initial food data
mysql -u username -p database_name < src/database/food_data.sql
```

### Update Configuration File
```php
// Edit src/config/config.php
define('DB_HOST', 'your_nexcess_db_host');
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
define('DB_USER', 'your_db_username');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_db_password');
define('BASE_URL', 'https://yourdomain.com');
```
